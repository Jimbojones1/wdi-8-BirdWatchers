## Homework & Project Grading

- Students will be provided feedback **only** for on-time homework submissions.
- **Homework must be submitted via pull request no later than Midnight CST.** Any work submitted past this deadline will *not* be counted.
- Students will be provided feedback through Github. Please make sure you have your primary email address associated with your Github account for email notifications.

- During project sprints, feedback will be provided as guidance, mentoring, problem solving, and 1:1s.

#### Homework Grading

- Homework assignments will be graded as **complete**, **incomplete**, or **missing**.
- Homework assignments may be turned in late but it is the student's responsibility to ask for an assignment to be evaluated.
- Projects will be assigned a graded rubric based on project deliverables.
- Based on each project's rubric, it may be assessed as **complete**, **incomplete**, or **missing**.
- Students should expect feedback 24-48 hours after an assignment's due date.
- Students that submit homework late will need to request an instructor to review it (as we may not notice it).


#### Project Grading & Feedback

- Projects will be assigned a graded rubric based on project deliverables.
- Based on each project's rubric, it may be assessed as **complete**, **incomplete**, or **missing**.
- Failure to **complete** any project qualifies a student for a **Student Support Plan**.
- For each project you will be provided written feedback on your application from your instructors the following week of project presentations.
- Students will present their project in a presentation and perform an in-class peer code review.
- Presentations will be recorded if requested.
- Failure to **complete** any project qualifies a student for a **Student Support Plan**.

#### Homework Submission

> This submission process will be covered in class.

  0. You will be assigned homework from a specific Git repository.
  1. Browse to `wdi/name_of_your_project`
  2. `git add .` all of your changes to the Git purgatory.
  3. `git commit -m "your commit message"` to commit your changes from the Git purgatory into your branch.
  4. `git pull upstream master` to gather any changes from the base repository
  5. `git push origin master` to push your changes to your own fork!
  6. Inside of your fork, create a new **pull request**.
  7. Submit the pull request for your instructors to check!

That's all! We will practice this workflow during class repeatedly to get you comfortable with it.
