## Exercise: Modules

Partner up with your neighbor - your task is to make a module together (`Car.js`) and that defines a car – with both properties and functions – and export it as a module to an `index.js` file.

In the `Car.js` file:

Properties should include:
- color, convertible (boolean), speed (0, at first)

Functions specs:
- include accelerate and decelerate
  - these should take one argument, the speed, and add or substract it the from the current speed
  - return a string with the old speed and new speed
- call these functions at the bottom of the file

In the `index.js` file, be sure to require the module and console log a message about your car object, including the current speed of the car.
