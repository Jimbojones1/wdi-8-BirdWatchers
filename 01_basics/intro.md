# Week 1: The Basics

Welcome to WDI 7, the fifth version of our Web Development Immersive course. You've had an easy first day of class but now things are about to speed up and get challenging. Don't worry though, we're here to help. __If you feel like you need extra help please sign up for office hours with either Bill or Jim__ and be sure to ask questions during class. 

## What to expect/what we'll cover

This week we're going to be introducing you to a bunch of new concepts, tools, and techniques. It'll be a mix  of computer history, concept lectures, and exercises which will cover a variety of topics including:

- HTML/CSS Basics
- Using the terminal
- Git and GitHub (they're two different things!)
- Chrome and the developer tools

## Taking Notes

Remember when we told you that you didn't need to take too many notes? Well this is why! The notes are all in the GitBook! As we cover the topics try following along and don't worry about taking notes. You'll find all the important information you need here.

If you find that there are gaps in the notes we added to this GitBook then just let us know and we'll add the information you need here.

## Let's get started

With all that said, welcome to week 1! Let's get started...
