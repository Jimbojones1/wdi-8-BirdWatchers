##Loop Js

### use a for loop to solve the following problems

1.  Write a for loop that will iterate from 0 to 20.
For each iteration, it will check if the current
number is even or odd,
and `console.log` the result (e.g. "2 is even").

2.  Define a variable named myBagOfBeans and set it equal to fifty.
loop down from a hundred and if the number is even add the current value to myBagOfBeans.

3.  Loop through this array, and seperate the drinks, the food, and the sauces into seperate arrays.

`var arrayOfStringsRememberIcanNameMyVariablesAnythingIWant =
    ['cheese', 'pepperoni', 'sausage', 'coca cola', 'lemonade', 'dough', 'beer', 'wine', 'ranch', 'blue cheese', 'bbq sauce'];`

4.  Loop through the following array and push the items that are not numbers
into a seperate array

`var mixedArray = [1, 2, 3, 'taco', 4, 5, 6, 'burrito', 7, 8, 9, 'Whats the deal with airplane peanuts', 3.14, {barry: "Mannilow",}, 6, 55, null, "Old " + "Crow " + " Medicine Show", 3, 2, "I want the calzone from pizanos", "Death blow", "Firestorm", "48", 30]`

5.  Loop through the following array and push the items that make up a cheese burger,
or spaghetti into a seperate array name dinner.

`var food = ['bun', "jalepeno cheddar", "elk", "beef", "1954 ford mustang", 1.14, 1.23, 'hot dog', "gary clark jr",  " I'lll never fall in love again", "mustard", "ketchup", 30, 50, 80, "grilled onions", "egg", "Dr. Suess"]`

### Use a `for in` loop to loop through the following objects and print to the console,
the name of each property.

6.  `var colorObjects = {red: 'red', blue: 'blue', cyan: 'cyan'}`

7.  `var seinfeld    = {cosmo: "kramer", jerry: "Seinfeld", george: "constanza", elaine: "bennis"}`

8.  `var profile       = {name: "Elon Musk", occupation: "space man", hobbies: ["paypal", "space X", "rocket science"]}`



### Use a `for loop` or a `for in` loop and print out the properties of the object or value of the indexin the array,  Above your code write in a comment what loop you are using and why


9.  `var oldTime = ["benton flippen", "carter family", "roscoe Holcomb", "gus cannon", "Tommy Jarrell"];`

10. `var sandwhich = {name: "sunday morning special", bread: "ciabatta", cheese: "pepper jack", green: "arugala", redStuff: "cherry tomatoes", heated: true}`

11. `var zeppelin = ["In through the out door", "Zep 1", "Zep 2", "Zep3", "Zep4", "Physical Graffiti"]`

### Homework Questions:

1. Write a JavaScript for loop that will iterate from 0 to 20. For each iteration, it will check if the current number is odd or even, and display a message to the screen.

3. Write a JavaScript program which iterates the integers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".

4. Write a JavaScript program to construct the following pattern.

	x  
	xx  
	xxx  
	xxxx  
	xxxxx

5. Print each of the keys and values from the following object: {a:1, b:2, c:3}

6. Create a loop that "sings" the song 99 bottles of beer on the wall. The song repeats in this fashion until there are 0 bottles on the wall:
"99 bottles of beer on the wall, 99 bottles of beer. Take one down, pass it around, 98 bottles of beer on the wall."
"98 bottles of beer on the wall, 98 bottles of beer. Take one down, pass it around, 97 bottles of beer on the wall."
