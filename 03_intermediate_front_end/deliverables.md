### Technical Requirements

Your app must:

* **Render a game in the browser**
* **Switch turns** between two players or more (or defend why you are not)
* **Design logic for winning** & **visually display which player won**
* **Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files**
* Stick with **KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid)** and **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** principles
* Use **Javascript or jQuery** for **DOM manipulation**
* **Deploy your game online**, where the rest of the world can access it
* Use **semantic markup** for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)


### Necessary Deliverables

**These are what you will be graded on!**

* A **working game, built by you**, hosted somewhere on the internet
* A **link to your hosted working game** in the URL section of your Github repo. This must be placed inside of `your_username.github.io` in a folder called `project1`. It will then be accessible via http://your_username.github.io/project1/
* A **git repository hosted on Github**, with a link to your hosted game, and frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project. We strongly encourage you to work our of the repository `your_username.github.io`
* **A ``readme.md`` file** with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.
